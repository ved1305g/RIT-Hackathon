2025-03-21 21:40:18,how can i trust strenger  who is behaving very sweetly to me,"Okay, so someone's being extra nice and you're sus? 🤔 Totally get it. Trust is earned, not given! Here's the tea:

*   **Vibes Check:** Trust your gut feeling. If something feels off, it probably is. 🚩
*   **Time Tells All:** Don't rush into trusting them. See if their actions match their sweet words over time.
*   **Keep It 💯:** Boundaries are your bestie! Don't share too much personal info too soon.
*   **Friends in Common?:** Ask around! See if anyone you know has experience with this person.

Basically, be friendly, but stay alert. Play it cool, and don't hand over your trust until they've proven they deserve it. 😉 You got this! 💖"

*   **Hit up a friend:** Even a quick text or meme exchange can help. 📱
*   **Get outta your space:** Library, coffee shop, park – new vibes! 🚶‍♀️🌳
*   **Do something you love:** Games, art, music, whatever makes you happy! 🎮🎨🎵
*   **Volunteer:** Helping others is a major mood booster. 🙌

Remember, you're awesome and you're not alone. This feeling will pass! ❤️✨"
